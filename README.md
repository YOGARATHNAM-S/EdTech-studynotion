- Removed for brevity

To use Cosmo Cloud in your application, you'll need to integrate it based on the services it offers, such as cloud storage, hosting, or media management. Here’s a general guide on how to use Cosmo Cloud in your MERN stack application like StudyNotion:
1. Cosmo Cloud Setup

    Sign Up/Log In: Create an account on Cosmo Cloud.
    API Access: After logging in, get access to Cosmo Cloud's API key, secret, or other necessary credentials.

2. Integrating Cosmo Cloud in the Backend (Node.js/Express)
a. Install Required Packages

You might need an SDK or an API client to interact with Cosmo Cloud services from your backend. If Cosmo Cloud provides an NPM package or recommends using an API client, install it using:

bash

npm install cosmo-cloud-sdk  # Replace with the actual package name

b. Configure Cosmo Cloud in Your Application

In your backend code, set up Cosmo Cloud by configuring its API key and other required parameters. Add this configuration in a .env file or a configuration file to manage your keys securely.

js

require('dotenv').config();
const CosmoCloud = require('cosmo-cloud-sdk');  // Replace with actual package

const cosmoCloud = new CosmoCloud({
  apiKey: process.env.COSMO_CLOUD_API_KEY, // Stored securely in .env file
  secret: process.env.COSMO_CLOUD_SECRET, 
  cloudName: process.env.COSMO_CLOUD_NAME,
});

c. Upload Files to Cosmo Cloud

If your app needs to upload course content, images, or other media to the cloud, you’ll need to create a route to handle file uploads to Cosmo Cloud:

js

const multer = require('multer'); // Middleware for handling file uploads
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });  // Temp storage

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const result = await cosmoCloud.upload(req.file.path);  // Upload to Cosmo Cloud
    res.json({ url: result.url });  // Respond with the file URL
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Upload failed');
  }
});

3. Integrating Cosmo Cloud in the Frontend (React.js)
a. Sending Files from Frontend to Backend

In your React frontend, you can use a file input to allow users to upload media files, and then send them to your backend to handle Cosmo Cloud uploads.

js

import { useState } from 'react';

function UploadComponent() {
  const [file, setFile] = useState(null);

  const handleUpload = async () => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);

    const response = await fetch('/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('File uploaded successfully:', data.url);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" onChange={(e) => setFile(e.target.files[0])} />
      <button onClick={handleUpload}>Upload</button>
    </div>
  );
}

4. Using Media in Application

Once files are uploaded to Cosmo Cloud, you can use the file URLs (returned after successful uploads) in your app, for example, embedding course videos or images.

js

<img src={uploadedImageUrl} alt="Course Image" />

5. Other Features

Depending on Cosmo Cloud’s services, you can also:

    Stream media (if they offer video hosting).
    Manage and manipulate images (e.g., cropping, resizing).
    Handle user authentication if Cosmo Cloud provides such services.

6. Deploy the Application

Once the application is ready, deploy it on platforms like Vercel (for frontend) or other hosting services for the backend. Ensure your environment variables for Cosmo Cloud are set correctly in the hosting environment.

By integrating Cosmo Cloud in your StudyNotion application, you can leverage its cloud capabilities to manage media, course content, and possibly other resources depending on the specific services Cosmo Cloud offers
